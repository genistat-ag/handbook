# Genistat Handbook

This handbook aims to document and shape the culture at Genistat. 

We document our core values, assumptions and beliefs because it reduces the need for detailed processes.
Documenting makes those values visible, to us, to clients, to partners and to potential new colleagues.

This handbook also shapes our culture, because it gives us something to benchmark our actions against.
When we feel that our actions don't align with the handbook, we can have a detailed discussion.
The output of this discussion is either an amendment to our actions or our handbook.

The handbook is a living document. 
It should, however, not be alive like a chat group, where one message chases the other and keeping up takes time.
It should also not be like the holy bible, where changing punctuation requires a three-week retreat by the Pope.
Instead, it should be seen like a basic science textbook: Describing fundamental laws in simple language and with concrete examples.
It doesn't always cover the most cutting edge results, but it gets updated from time to time to keep it fresh.
