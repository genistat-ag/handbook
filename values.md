# Values

## We are kind

We are kind to our clients and partners. 
But more importantly, we are kind to our colleagues and to ourselves.
Being kind allows everybody to feel at ease and do their best work.
It's also more fun.

We are kind, but not weak. We don't avoid conflict but make it about the cause and not the person. 

## We are straightforward

We communicate clearly and honestly with colleagues, clients and partners.
Straightforward communication is a skill we practise and cherish. 

We admit mistakes. We praise colleagues.

## We are makers

We take joy from creating things that work. 

Finished artefacts is how we measure our progress.

We know the inherent difficulty in creating something that works, that is robust, fast and elegant.
We know we need to make trade-offs and we try to improve our craft continuously.

When in doubt, do.
"It's better to get forgiveness than permission."

## We are independent

We encourage independent thought and original thinking.
