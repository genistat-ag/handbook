# Values

## We are kind

We are kind to our clients and partners. 
But more importantly, we are kind to our colleagues and to ourselves.
Being kind allows everybody to feel at ease and do their best work.
It's also more fun.

We are kind, but not weak. We don't avoid conflict but make it about the cause and not the person. 

## We are straightforward

We communicate clearly and honestly with colleagues, clients and partners.
Straightforward communication is a skill we practise and cherish. 

We admit mistakes. We praise colleagues.

## We are makers

We take joy from creating things that work. 

We measure our progress through finished work.

We know the inherent difficulty in creating something that works, that is robust, fast and elegant.
We know we need to make trade-offs, and we try to improve our craft continuously.

When in doubt, do.
"It's better to get forgiveness than permission."

## We are independent

We encourage independent thought and original thinking.

## We are curious

We are curious about new technologies and about what's going on in the company. We show interest in the work of our colleagues and help each other out.

We are never too proud to admit that we don't know something or to ask for advice. There is no reason to feel bad if we don't know something.

Before we begin with a new project or start working with a new technology, we do profound research and try to figure out how others have tackled similar challenges. We don't try to reinvent the wheel, but find smart ways to combine existing solutions.
