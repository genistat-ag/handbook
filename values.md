# Values

## We are kind

We are kind to our clients and partners. 
But more importantly, we are kind to our colleagues and to ourselves.
We help where we can.
We forgive mistakes.
We don't assume hidden motives until we know for sure.

We work in teams. It's kind to ourselves and our colleagues.

Being kind doesn't mean that everything is always rosy, that there is no conflict. 
Tell colleagues when you don't like something about their work.
But make it come from a place where you want them to improve.
Be kind to yourself and the team, and tell a client when you feel that they abuse us.

## We are straightforward

We communicate clearly and honestly with colleagues, clients and partners.
Convoluted communication puts the burden to unpack the message onto the receiving party.
If you don't understand something, say it.
If you messed up, say it.
You can expect your colleagues to be kind.

## We are makers

We value ideas.
Abstract discussions can be helpful.
But in the end, only a finished artefact is something we can show to the outside world.
Only a finished artefact is something we can build upon.
Only a finished artefact is something we can be genuinely proud of. 

We know the inherent difficulty in creating something that works, that is robust, fast and elegant.
We know we need to make trade-offs. We try to improve at making cool things continually.

## We are independent

Sometimes being kind, being part of a team, wanting things to change for the better, means standing alone for a bit.
Independent thought is the seed of all change.
