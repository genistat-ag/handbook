# Values

## We care

We care about our clients and partners.

We care about the well-being of our colleagues and our own.

## We are straightforward

We communicate clearly and honestly with colleagues, clients and partners.
Straightforward communication is a skill we practise and cherish. 

We admit mistakes. We praise colleagues.

## We are makers

We take joy from creating things that work. 

We measure our progress through finished work.

We know the inherent difficulty in creating something that works, that is robust, fast and elegant.
We know we need to make trade-offs, and we try to improve our craft continuously.

When in doubt, do.
"It's better to get forgiveness than permission."

## We are independent

We encourage independent thought and original thinking.
